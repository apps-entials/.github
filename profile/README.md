## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

In this organization, I am coding all kinds of apps that interest me. Currently I am working on [jass-entials](https://github.com/apps-entials/jass-entials), an Android app that enables the users to play different Jass variations such as Sidi Barrani, Schieber, and Coiffeur.
